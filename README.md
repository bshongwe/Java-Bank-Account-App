# Python-Bank-Account-App
I'm trying to create a simple Python program that simulates a basic bank account application that does the following:

1. The BankApplication class is the entry point of the program. It prompts the user to enter their name and customer ID using the Scanner class, creates a BankAccount object with the provided information, and calls the menu() method of the BankAccount object. #I need to insert PIN CODE prompt.

2. The BankAccount class represents a bank account. It has instance variables bal (balance), prevTrans (previous transaction), customerName, and customerId. The constructor initializes the customerName and customerId variables with the provided values.
