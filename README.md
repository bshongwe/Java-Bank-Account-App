# Java-Bank-Account-App
I'm trying to create a simple Java program that simulates a basic bank account application that does the following:

1. The BankApplication class is the entry point of the program. It prompts the user to enter their name and customer ID using the Scanner class, creates a BankAccount object with the provided information, and calls the menu() method of the BankAccount object.
